# Unified Threat Intelligence & Predictive Analytics Platform

**Automated cyber threat detection, prediction, and business impact analysis using technical logs, threat intel, and business data.**

---

## **Project Description**

This platform integrates security logs (firewall, endpoint, cloud), external threat intelligence, and business event data to detect, predict, and quantify cyber threats using automation, analytics, and AI/ML. It delivers real-time dashboards, automated alerts, and business impact simulations—demonstrating hands-on skills in cybersecurity, data science, and business analytics.

---

## **Technologies Used**

- **Python** (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, lightgbm, tensorflow)
- **Data Visualization** (matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, dash/streamlit)
- **Threat Intelligence APIs** (VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB—mock or real)
- **Business Analytics** (real or synthetic event data)
- **Git/GitHub** for version control

---

## **Installation & Setup**

1. **Clone this repository.**
2. **Install dependencies.**
3. **Add your data.**  
Place log files in `data/logs/`, threat feeds in `data/threat_feeds/`, and business data in `data/business/`.
4. **Run the processing pipeline.**  
Execute scripts in this order:
5. **Explore dashboards and notebooks.**  
Open `dashboards/` for dashboard exports and `notebooks/` for Jupyter analysis.
